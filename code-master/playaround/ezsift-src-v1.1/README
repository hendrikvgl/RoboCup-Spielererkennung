File list:
The following files are used to compile the ezSIFT library:
util/vvector.h
util/timer.h
util/img_io.h
util/img_io.cpp
util/image.h
common.h
ezsift.h
ezsift.cpp

I also provide two examples showing how to use this library:
examples/feature_extract.cpp: detect keypoints and extract feature descriptor from a single image.
examples/image_match.cpp: detect keypoints and extract features from two images and perform feature matching.
